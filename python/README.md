## Learning Python

Python, as a scripting language, is quite unknown to me. This directory focuses on my process of learning Python.

### Programs within this folder:
1. A Hello World program that prints hello world as many times as the user wants using loops.
2. A palindrome checker that checks if a word is a palindrome. Multiple palindromes can be checked at the same time.
3. A File Reader program that reads a file and prints out the number of lines and vowels.
4. An improved palindrome checker that implements file reading, case sensitivity handling.
